- email (text)
- phone (text)
- user_type (text) - 'renter', 'owner', or 'admin'
- status (text) - 'active', 'suspended', or 'blocked'
- created_at (timestamp)
```

### admin_actions table
```sql
- id (uuid)
- admin_id (uuid) - references admin who took action
- action (text) - 'block_user', 'unblock_user', 'delete_user', etc.
- target_type (text) - 'user' or 'property'
