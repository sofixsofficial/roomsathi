## 📝 Image Upload Limitation

**Note**: Image upload is currently limited by Expo Go constraints:
- Expo Go doesn't support custom native image upload modules
- Currently uses placeholder Unsplash images
- Properties are still listed with text information
- For production, use EAS Build to add image upload capabilities

**Workaround**:
- Properties without images are still visible with all text information
- Provider can see "Image required" note in the form
- All other property details are fully functional

## 🔐 Admin Credentials

**Default Admin Account**:
- Email: `admin@roomrent.com`
- Password: `admin123456`

**To Create New Admin**:
```sql
UPDATE public.users 
SET user_type = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
