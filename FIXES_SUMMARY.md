# Fixes and Updates Summary

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. Fixed "Mark Booked" Status Update Error
**Problem:** The status update was failing because the code was trying to set status to 'available' instead of 'active'.

**Solution:** Updated `app/provider/my-listings.tsx` to toggle between 'active' and 'booked' statuses:
- When property is 'active' → Mark as 'booked'
- When property is 'booked' → Mark as 'active' (available)

**File Changed:** `app/provider/my-listings.tsx` (Line 86)

The edit functionality is fully functional. When you click "Edit" button:

- Loads all property data
- Allows modification of all property details
- Updates the property in the database

**Location:** Provider My Listings → Edit button on each property card

### 3. Delete Functionality - Already Working ✓

Mark as Booked → 'booked' (rented/not available)
↓
Mark as Available → 'active' (available again)
```
