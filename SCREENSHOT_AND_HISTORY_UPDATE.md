# Screenshot and History Updates

## Changes Made

### ✅ Screenshot Functionality for Finders
**Status: Already Enabled**

Finder (renter) users can take screenshots and record screen videos on property detail pages.

**Location**: `app/property/[id].tsx` (lines 639-645)
```typescript
{user?.userType === 'renter' && property && (
  <ScreenCaptureControls
    viewRef={contentViewRef}
    propertyId={property.id}
    propertyTitle={property.title}
  />
)}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Screenshot capture with watermark
- ✅ Screen recording (30 seconds max)
- ✅ Automatic saving to database
- ✅ History tracking in finder_history table
- ✅ Share/Download captured content
- ✅ Works on both mobile and web (with platform-specific handling)

**Actions Tracked**:
- Screenshots are logged as 'screenshot' action
- Screen recordings are logged as 'video_recording' action

### ✅ History Filter Buttons - Simplified UI

**What Changed**: Made filter buttons smaller and icon-only (except "All" button)

**File**: `app/(tabs)/history.tsx`

**Before**:
- Large buttons with icons + text labels
- Example: `[📞] Calls`, `[💬] WhatsApp`, etc.

**After**:
- Compact icon-only buttons (smaller, cleaner look)
- "All" button still has text
- Other buttons show only icons: 📞, 💬, 📍, 💬, 📅
- Reduced padding and size for better space efficiency

**Filter Categories**:
1. **All** - Shows all activities
2. **📞 Call** - Phone call interactions
3. **💬 WhatsApp** - WhatsApp contacts
4. **📍 Visit** - Property visit requests
5. **💬 Message** - Direct messages
6. **📅 Booking** - Booking requests
